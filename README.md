# FAQ

**Q: I have a feature request! Where can I post it?**
> A: You may post feature requests [here](https://github.com/Cosmental/Social-Chat/issues/new)! It may take me a while to see your request but I'll give it a special tag if it ends up being accepted into the next Social Chat update!

**Q: I have a bug report! How can I reach you?**
> A: You can report bug reports [here](https://github.com/Cosmental/Social-Chat/issues/new) or add me on discord with your question! (Cos#5856)

**Q: How can I make my own gif emoji?**
> A: You can make your own gif emoji by creating a spritesheet for it using a [conversion tool](https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite) online and following the instructions found [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/spriteclip-sprite-sheet-animation-module/294195)! I did not make the SpriteClip module; therefore, I would like to request that any questions regarding gif's are asked within it's own DevForum post.
